:no_entry_sign:**The Problem:**

In 2025, the advertising industry is expected to lose over $100 billion due to ad fraud and ineffective strategies. Ad fraud, including fake clicks and bot traffic, inflates engagement metrics and wastes significant ad spend. Traditional models, like pay-per-click and pay-per-impression, often fail to deliver real value, as they don't directly correlate with actual sales, leading to wasted budgets and reduced trust. 

The rise of AI is expected to significantly increase the potential for ad fraud over the next five years by 20-30%.
This increase could lead to global losses exceeding $150 billion annually by 2028, as fraudsters use AI to generate more convincing fake clicks, impressions, and user interactions. 

:bulb:**The Solution:**

BitAds addresses these challenges by focusing on actual sales rather than clicks or impressions. With its newly implemented Conversion Tracking system on Bittensor Subnet 16, BitAds ensures advertisers only pay for successful sales, reducing fraud and guaranteeing that every dollar spent leads to real outcomes. Miners earn TAO rewards based on the sales they generate, not just traffic, driving higher-quality advertising.

# Integration with Bittensor
BitAds leverages Bittensorâ€™s decentralized network to distribute marketing tasks among miners, with Validators evaluating the sales generated by miners and scoring them accordingly.
By harnessing the collaborative efforts of the network's participants, BitAds aims to significantly enhance Bittensor's visibility and adoption, laying a strong foundation for the future growth of both BitAds and Bittensor.

# Integration with Shopify
BitAds is now fully integrated with Shopify through the BitAds app. This app enables detailed tracking of sales on any website where it is installed, identifying the specific miner's unique link used and the exact products purchased.

# Integration with Stripe (In Progress)
With Stripe integration (currently in progress), BitAds will become a powerful growth engine not only for the Bittensor ecosystem but for any online platform. This integration allows BitAds to seamlessly onboard every subnet service, product, or website into its incentive-driven marketing framework.

BitAds will be able to integrate with Shopify (already integrated and working), WooCommerce, custom-built shops, and service platforms of all kinds, empowering miners to promote these platforms and attract new users and paying customers. By incentivizing miners to drive real sales, BitAds creates a network effect that fuels adoption and revenue growth for participating subnets and external platforms alike.

BitAds plays a crucial role in attracting new users and generating revenue, making it an essential solution for growing both the Bittensor ecosystem and online businesses across the global digital marketplace.

# The BitAds.ai Ecosystem

**BitAds.ai platform:**<br> Serves as the central hub for managing and analyzing marketing campaigns, offering essential tools for both miners and validators.<br><br>
**Validators:**<br> Use the platform to create and manage marketing campaigns, evaluating and scoring miners' tasks based on a defined scoring mechanism.<br><br>
**Miners:**<br> Promote these campaigns across the internet using their unique links and are rewarded with TAO tokens for successfully driving sales. <br><br>
**Incentive Mechanism:**<br>
Miners are incentivized with TAO tokens, not based on the client's payment offer, but on the sales they attract. This system ensures cost-effective advertising for clients while rewarding miners substantially for their efforts.
<br><br>

# How BitAds works?

1. Advertisers launch marketing campaigns on BitAds through one of the apps built on top of the platform. <br>
2. BitAds leverages the Bittensor network to distribute marketing tasks among miners. <br>
3. These miners promote campaigns across the web, driving real sales and earning TAO rewards based on their effectiveness. <br>
4. Validators then evaluate and score these efforts, ensuring transparency and fairness in the process.

# Advantages of BitAds.ai

**Decentralization** <br>
BitAds emphasizes optimal decentralization by ensuring a broad distribution of miners and validators.

**Multi-Strategy Marketing Approach** <br>
When advertisers use BitAds, theyâ€™re essentially tapping into hundreds or even thousands of different marketing strategies deployed by miners simultaneously.

**Cost-Effectiveness** <br>
By operating on low-cost systems requirements and incentivizing miners with TAO tokens, BitAds offers a highly economical marketing solution for both parties, advertisers (clients) and miners (promoters).

**High-Quality Traffic** <br>
The incentive mechanism encourages miners to drive sales and achieve high conversion rates for the products or services being promoted through marketing campaigns.

**Competitive Environment** <br>
The competitive environment fostered among miners ensures continuous innovation and optimization of marketing strategies, leading to high-quality traffic and better sales outcomes.

**Income Sources for Validators** <br>
Validators on BitAds can generate income through multiple channels, including promoting their own products, developing applications on the platform, or offering paid access to their APIs.

# Scoring Mechanism

The scoring formula for BitAds miners incorporates a thoughtful approach to quantifying the effectiveness and impact of miners based on multiple key performance indicators.

**The Main Parameters:**

**1. Total visits (TV)** <br>
This measures the total number of distinct visitors directed to the campaign via the miner's unique link. It's a direct indicator of the reach and traffic generated by the miner.

**2. Total Sales (TS)** <br>
This measures the total number of sales generated by the miner.

**3. Sales amount (SA)** <br>
This parameter will indicate the total amount of sales in fiat currency (dollars).

**4. Conversion Rate (CR)** <br>
The percentage of visitors who bought the product. 

**5. Miner Repuation (MR) ** <br>
This parameter will be based on the miner's number of sales on the last 30 days.

**6. Total Refunds (TR)** <br>
Total number of refunds occurring from specific miner.

**7. Refunds Percentage (RP)** <br>
This will indicate the percentage of buyers who asked for a refund.<br> 
```bash
( RP = TR/TS)
```

**8. Refunds Score (RS)** <br>
This value will help us penalize miners who receive too many refunds from buyers. This measure is designed to prevent score manipulation, where miners might be incentivized to purchase the products they promote and then request refunds to artificially boost their scores. <br> <br>

**Maximum Expected Values:** These are set to normalize the Main Parameters values (SA, CR and MR), ensuring they're scaled to a value between 0 and 1.
```bash
SALESmax = $500 standard (this value will be calculated based on the average amount that a miner sold in the last 30 days)
CRmax = 0.05
MRmax = 100 standard (this value will also be calculated based on the average number of sales per miner on the last 30 days)

SALESnorm = SALES / SALESmax
CRnorm = CR / CRmax
MRnorm = MR / MRmax
```
The Weights of the main parameters (SA, CR and MR). By adjusting these values we can decide on the importance of each parameter relative to the other.
```bash
Wsales = 0.90
Wcr = 0.05
Wmr = 0.05
```
**Miner Score:**
```bash
MINER SCORE = ((Wsales * SALESnorm) + (Wcr * CRnorm) + (Wmr * MRnorm)) * RS
```

**Conditions:**
- If MINER SCORE > 1 then MINER SCORE = 1
- MINER SCORE will have maximum 5 decimals

# The First Incentivized Marketing Task
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/keyvault_store.jpg" alt="keyvault.store" width="75%" />
</p>
In the beginning, BitAds will work with its own Shopify store, incentivizing Bittensor miners to attract sales for Microsoft software licenses. We are also looking to collaborate with more online stores to demonstrate the network's marketing capabilities and incentivizing participation. <br>

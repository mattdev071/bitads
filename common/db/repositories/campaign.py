    Retrieves a list of active campaign entities from the database based on optional block range.

    Notes:
        - If neither `from_block` nor `to_block` is provided, retrieves all active campaigns.
        - If only `from_block` is provided, retrieves active campaigns with `last_active_block` greater than `from_block`.
